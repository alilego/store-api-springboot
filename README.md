# store-api-springboot

A minimal store management API built with Spring Boot, Java 17, H2, and role-based security.

---

## üéØ Goal

Design and implement a minimal but realistic store management backend with role-based access and clear structure. Focus is placed on clean API contracts, Java 17+ features, error handling, and maintainability.

## üì° API Examples

### Create a Product (ADMIN only)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u admin:adminpass \
  -d '{
    "name": "Premium Widget",
    "price": 99.99
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Premium Widget",
  "price": 99.99,
  "version": 0,
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### List All Products (USER/ADMIN)
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/products?page=0&size=10&sortBy=id&direction=asc" \
  -u user:userpass
```

Response:
```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Premium Widget",
      "price": 99.99,
      "version": 0,
      "createdAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "pageable": {
    "pageNumber": 0,
    "pageSize": 10,
    "sort": {
      "sorted": true,
      "direction": "ASC"
    }
  },
  "totalElements": 1,
  "totalPages": 1,
  "last": true,
  "first": true,
  "size": 10,
  "number": 0
}
```

Query Parameters:
- `page`: Page number (default: 0)
- `size`: Items per page (default: 10)
- `sortBy`: Field to sort by (default: "id")
- `direction`: Sort direction - "asc" or "desc" (default: "asc")

### Get Product by ID (USER/ADMIN)
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/products/1 \
  -u user:userpass
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Premium Widget",
  "price": 99.99,
  "version": 0,
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Update Product Price (ADMIN only)
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/products/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u admin:adminpass \
  -d '{
    "price": 89.99,
    "version": 1
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Premium Widget",
  "price": 89.99,
  "version": 2,
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T10:15:00Z"
}
```

Note: The `version` field is optional. If provided, the update will only succeed if it matches the current version in the database (optimistic locking). If omitted, the update will proceed regardless of the current version.

### Delete Product (ADMIN only)
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/products/1 \
  -u admin:adminpass
```

Response: HTTP 204 No Content

Note: This performs a soft delete, marking the product as deleted in the database while preserving its data.

## üß™ Postman Collection

A comprehensive Postman collection is provided in the `/postman` directory for testing all API endpoints. The collection includes:

- Pre-configured environment variables
- Test cases for all endpoints
- Role-based authentication tests
- Pagination and sorting examples
- Error handling scenarios

### Setup

1. Import `postman/Store API.postman_collection.json` into Postman
2. The collection uses these environment variables:
   - `baseUrl`: `http://localhost:8080`
   - `adminAuthHeader`: Base64 encoded admin credentials
   - `userAuthHeader`: Base64 encoded user credentials

### Test Cases Include

- Success scenarios for all endpoints
- Role-based access control testing
- Input validation error cases
- Pagination and sorting variations
- Version control testing for updates
- Error handling for various HTTP status codes

For detailed documentation about the test cases and usage, see `/postman/README.md`.

  - JDBC URL `jdbc:h2:mem:storedb`
  - username: `sa`
  - password: `pass`

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
This project follows a classic **layered architecture** with:
- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests/responses and input validation
- Services: Implement business logic and transaction management
- Repositories: Handle data access using Spring Data JPA
- DTOs: Manage data transfer objects for clean API contracts
- Models: Define JPA entities with auditing support

Target: clear separation of concerns & maintainability.

## üîß Tech Stack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 (in-memory DB)
- Maven
- JUnit 5
- SLF4J / Logback for logging

---

## üß† Design Decisions

- **Top-Down Approach**: Started from API contract to ensure clarity and focus on business 1st.
- **H2 In-Memory DB**: Simulates real persistence with minimal setup; integrates cleanly with Spring Data JPA.
- **In-Memory Security**: Simple, role-based authentication using Spring Security to demonstrate access control.
- **Layered Structure**: Separation of concerns (Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository) for clarity and testability.
- **Optimistic Locking**: Version-based concurrency control for price updates.
- **Soft Deletes**: Products are marked as deleted rather than physically removed.
- **Auditing**: Automatic tracking of creation and modification timestamps.
- **Pagination**: Built-in support for large datasets with sorting options.
- **Minimal CI Testing**: Unit & integration testing for service layer to demonstrate code testability, as per assignment scope.

## ‚ùå Excluded by Design
- Frontend
- Persistent external DB
- OAuth2 / JWT authentication
